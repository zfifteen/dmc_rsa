# QMC Directions - Enhanced QMC Implementation Guide

**October 2025**

This document describes the enhanced QMC (Quasi-Monte Carlo) capabilities implemented for RSA factorization, following best practices from QMC theory and literature.

## Overview

The enhanced implementation provides:

1. **Replicated QMC with Cranley-Patterson randomization** for unbiased variance estimation
2. **Sobol with Owen scrambling** as the recommended default engine
3. **Smooth candidate mapping** to preserve low-discrepancy properties
4. **Enhanced metrics**: L2 discrepancy and stratification balance
5. **Confidence intervals** from independent QMC replicates

## Theoretical Foundation

### Why QMC Outperforms MC

Quasi-Monte Carlo methods provide deterministic, low-discrepancy sequences that reduce variance in numerical integration. The error bound for QMC is:

```
Error_QMC = O((log N)^s / N)
```

compared to Monte Carlo's:

```
Error_MC = O(1 / √N)
```

where `s` is the dimension. This advantage holds when the integrand has bounded Hardy-Krause variation (Koksma-Hlawka theorem).

### Cranley-Patterson Randomization

To obtain unbiased error estimates, we use Cranley-Patterson randomization:
- Run K independent QMC replicates with different random seeds
- Each replicate provides an independent estimate
- Variance across replicates gives confidence intervals

This is implemented in `run_replicated_qmc_analysis()`.

### Owen Scrambling

Owen scrambling for Sobol sequences:
- Preserves equidistribution properties
- Adds randomization for variance estimation
- Avoids axis artifacts and lattice alignments
- Implemented in scipy with `scramble=True`

### QMCConfig Dataclass

```python
@dataclass
class QMCConfig:
    dim: int              # Dimensionality (2 for current implementation)
    n: int                # Number of samples per replicate
    engine: str           # "sobol" | "halton"
    scramble: bool        # Owen scrambling (Sobol) or Faure (Halton)
    seed: int | None      # Random seed for reproducibility
    replicates: int       # Number of independent replicates
```

### Smooth Candidate Mapping

The `map_points_to_candidates()` function implements a smooth mapping from [0,1)² to integer candidates:

**Dimension 0:** Window position around √N
- Maps to offset in [-R, R] around floor(√N)
- Uses soft edges: jitter by half-step before rounding
- Avoids hard discontinuities

**Dimension 1:** Residue class filter
- Maps to residue classes {1, 3, 7, 9} mod 10
- Adjusts candidates with bounded forward search (≤4 steps)
- Keeps candidates odd

This design preserves the low-discrepancy properties by:
1. Avoiding hard accept/reject steps
2. Using bounded, smooth adjustments
3. Maintaining continuity in the transformation

## Usage Guide

### 1. Basic Replicated QMC Analysis

```python
from qmc_factorization_analysis import QMCFactorization

# Run replicated QMC analysis
results = QMCFactorization.run_replicated_qmc_analysis(
    n=899,                # Semiprime to factor
    num_samples=256,      # Power of 2 for Sobol
    num_replicates=16,    # For confidence intervals
    engine_type="sobol",  # Recommended
    scramble=True,        # Owen scrambling
    seed=42               # Reproducibility
)

# Access results
print(f"Mean unique candidates: {results['unique_count']['mean']:.2f}")
print(f"Std deviation: {results['unique_count']['std']:.2f}")
print(f"95% CI: [{results['unique_count']['ci_lower']:.2f}, "
      f"{results['unique_count']['ci_upper']:.2f}]")

# Quality metrics
print(f"L2 discrepancy: {results['l2_discrepancy']['mean']:.4f}")
print(f"Stratification balance: {results['stratification_balance']['mean']:.4f}")
```

### 2. Statistical Analysis with Enhanced Methods

```python
# Include enhanced methods in statistical analysis
df = QMCFactorization.run_statistical_analysis(
    n=899,
    num_samples=256,
    num_trials=50,
    include_enhanced=True  # Add Sobol-Owen and Halton-Scrambled
)

# Compare all methods
for _, row in df.iterrows():
    print(f"{row['method']}: {row['unique_count_mean']:.2f} "
          f"[{row['unique_count_ci_lower']:.2f}, {row['unique_count_ci_upper']:.2f}]")
```

### 3. Direct Engine Usage

```python
from qmc_engines import QMCConfig, qmc_points, map_points_to_candidates

# Configure engine
cfg = QMCConfig(
    dim=2,
    n=256,
    engine="sobol",
    scramble=True,
    seed=42,
    replicates=8
)

# Generate replicates and process
for replicate_idx, X in enumerate(qmc_points(cfg)):
    # X is (256, 2) array in [0,1)²
    candidates = map_points_to_candidates(X, n=899, window_radius=10)
    print(f"Replicate {replicate_idx}: {len(candidates)} candidates")
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Engine Selection

**Recommended: Sobol with Owen scrambling**
```python
engine_type="sobol"
scramble=True
```

**Reasons:**
- Best multidimensional stratification
- Owen scrambling provides unbiased variance estimation
- Well-supported in scipy.stats.qmc
- Superior to Halton in most cases

**Alternative: Halton with Faure permutations**
- Use for comparison or ablation studies
- May perform better in specific edge cases

### 2. Sample Size Selection

**Use powers of 2 for Sobol sequences:**
```python
num_samples = 256   # Good
num_samples = 512   # Good
num_samples = 200   # Warns: not power of 2
```

Sobol sequences have optimal balance properties when n is a power of 2. scipy will issue a warning otherwise.

### 3. Replicate Count

**Recommended: 8-32 replicates**
```python
num_replicates = 16  # Good balance
```

- Fewer (< 8): Wide confidence intervals
- More (> 32): Diminishing returns
- 16 is a good default for most applications

### 4. Dimensionality

**Keep dimensions modest: s ≤ 8-12**

Current implementation uses 2D:
- Dimension 0: Window position
- Dimension 1: Residue class

For future extensions (ECM σ, GNFS parameters):
- Add dimensions carefully
- Consider coordinate weights
- Monitor discrepancy metrics

### 5. Seed Management

**Always set seed for reproducibility:**
```python
seed=42  # Or any fixed integer
```

For production runs:
```python
seed=None  # Uses system entropy
```

## Metrics and Interpretation

### Unique Candidate Count
- Primary performance metric
- Higher is better (more coverage of search space)
- Compare with MC baseline using improvement ratio

### L2 Discrepancy
- Measures uniformity of point distribution in [0,1)^d
- Lower is better
- Typical values: 0.2-0.4 for well-distributed sequences
- Values > 0.5 indicate poor distribution

### Stratification Balance
- Measures distribution uniformity across bins
- Range: [0, 1], higher is better
- Values > 0.95 indicate excellent stratification
- Values < 0.8 indicate poor balance

### Confidence Intervals
- 95% CI from replicate standard error
- Non-overlapping CIs indicate statistical significance
- Tighter CIs indicate more consistent performance

## Validation Results

From `test_replicated_qmc.py` on N=899 (29×31):

```
Sobol with Owen Scrambling:
  Unique candidates: 12.81 ± 0.40
  95% CI: [12.61, 13.01]
  L2 discrepancy: 0.3341 ± 0.0017
  Stratification balance: 0.9684
  
Halton with Faure:
  Unique candidates: 12.88 ± 0.34
  95% CI: [12.71, 13.04]
  L2 discrepancy: 0.3333 ± 0.0030
```

Both engines perform well, with Sobol recommended as default.

## Comparison with Original Implementation

### Original Method
- Single QMC sequence per trial
- Halton base-2/base-3 implementation
- Linear mapping to candidates
- Bootstrap CI from multiple trials

### Enhanced Implementation
- Multiple independent QMC replicates
- Sobol with Owen scrambling (default)
- Smooth mapping with soft edges
- Direct CI from replicates (Cranley-Patterson)
- Additional quality metrics (L2 discrepancy, stratification balance)

### Performance
Original method (from test_large.py):
```
MC:  190.2 unique [188.2, 192.0]
QMC: 379.3 unique [377.3, 381.3]  (1.99× vs MC)
```

Enhanced method uses different mapping strategy, optimized for smooth transformations.

## Future Directions

### 1. ECM σ Parameter Sampling
- Map Sobol points to ECM σ values
- Cover σ-space more uniformly
- Reduce redundant "bad regions"
- Extend to {σ, B₁, B₂-block} space

### 2. GNFS Polynomial Selection
- Use QMC for polynomial parameter sweeps
- Cover (skew, root score, Murphy-E) space
- Benchmark at RSA-140 scale

### 3. Multi-Armed Bandits
- Wrap bandit over (QMC vs MC vs heuristics)
- Auto-reallocate budget to best performer
- Use randomized QMC for regret analysis

### 4. Higher Dimensions
- Extend to 4D-8D:
  - Window width variations
  - Multiple residue class schedules
  - Trial division gate positions
  - ECM curve parameters
- Use coordinate weights
- Monitor curse of dimensionality
