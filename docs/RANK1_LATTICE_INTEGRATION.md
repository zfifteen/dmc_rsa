# Rank-1 Lattice Integration for QMC RSA Factorization

## Overview

This document describes the integration of **subgroup-based rank-1 lattice constructions** from group theory into the Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) variance reduction framework for RSA factorization candidate sampling.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Background

Standard QMC methods (Sobol, Halton) provide 1.03-1.34× improvements over Monte Carlo sampling for RSA factorization by using low-discrepancy sequences. Rank-1 lattices offer an alternative approach with theoretically-motivated construction methods based on group theory.

### Group-Theoretic Construction

A **rank-1 lattice** is a point set in [0,1)^d defined by:

```
x_i = {i * z / n}  for i = 0, 1, ..., n-1
```

where:
- `z` is the **generating vector** (z₁, z₂, ..., z_d)
- `{·}` denotes fractional part
- `n` is the lattice size

The key innovation from arXiv:2011.06446 is using **cyclic subgroups** of finite abelian groups to construct the generating vector `z`, which provides:

1. **Reduced pairwise distances**: Lower bound based on subgroup order
2. **Enhanced regularity**: Better than exhaustive Korobov searches
3. **Theoretical guarantees**: Bounds on minimum distance and covering radius
4. **Group symmetry alignment**: Natural fit with (ℤ/Nℤ)* structure in RSA

### Connection to RSA

For RSA semiprime N = p × q:
- The multiplicative group (ℤ/Nℤ)* has order φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)
- This group is isomorphic to (ℤ/pℤ)* × (ℤ/qℤ)*, embedding cyclic subgroups
- Cyclic subgroup construction can leverage these algebraic symmetries
- While φ(N) is unknown a priori, approximations work well in practice

### Core Components

#### 1. Generating Vector Construction Methods

Three methods are implemented in `rank1_lattice.py`:

**a) Fibonacci (Golden Ratio) Construction**
```python
z_k = round(φ^(k+1) * n) mod n
```
- Uses golden ratio φ ≈ 1.618
- Aligns with φ-biased transformations in existing code
- Good general-purpose choice

**b) Korobov Construction**
```python
z = (1, a, a², ..., a^(d-1)) mod n
```
- Uses primitive root or good generator `a`
- Optimal for prime `n`
- Classical construction method

**c) Cyclic Subgroup Construction** (Novel)
```python
Select generators g from cyclic subgroup of order m in ℤ_n*
z_k = g_k^(k+1) mod n
```
- Based on arXiv:2011.06446
- Leverages group-theoretic structure
- Provides theoretical regularity guarantees
- Recommended for RSA applications

#### 2. Quality Metrics

The module computes lattice-specific quality metrics:

- **Minimum pairwise distance**: Lower bound on point separation
  - Theory: Bounded by O(1/n^(1/d)) for well-constructed lattices
  - Higher values indicate better regularity
  
- **Covering radius**: Maximum distance to nearest lattice point
  - Measures worst-case coverage
  - Lower values indicate better space-filling

- **L2 discrepancy**: Uniformity proxy (compatibility with existing QMC)
- **Stratification balance**: Bin distribution metric

#### 3. Integration with QMC Framework

Extended `QMCConfig` to support rank-1 lattices:

```python
cfg = QMCConfig(
    dim=2,
    n=128,
    engine="rank1_lattice",        # New option
    lattice_generator="cyclic",     # "fibonacci" | "korobov" | "cyclic"
    subgroup_order=20,              # For cyclic generator
    scramble=True,                  # Cranley-Patterson randomization
    seed=42
)
```

The `Rank1LatticeEngine` wrapper class provides scipy-compatible interface:
- Implements `random(n)` method
- Supports caching for efficiency
- Compatible with all existing QMC analysis functions

### RSA-Specific Features

#### φ(N) Calculation

For RSA semiprime N = p × q:
```python
phi_n = _euler_phi(n)  # Computes (p-1)(q-1) from factorization of n
```

For unknown factorization, approximation strategies:
- Use n-1 as upper bound
- Heuristic: φ(n) ≈ n - √n (for semiprimes)
- Subgroup order as fraction of φ(n)

#### Subgroup Order Selection

For cyclic subgroup construction:
```python
subgroup_order = max(2, phi_n // 20)  # Use φ(n)/20 as default
```

This ensures:
- Subgroup order divides φ(n) (approximately)
- Large enough for good regularity
- Small enough for efficient generation

## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from qmc_engines import QMCConfig, make_engine, map_points_to_candidates

# Create rank-1 lattice configuration
cfg = QMCConfig(
    dim=2,
    n=128,
    engine="rank1_lattice",
    lattice_generator="cyclic",
    subgroup_order=16,
    scramble=True,
    seed=42
)

# Generate lattice points
engine = make_engine(cfg)
points = engine.random(128)

# Map to RSA candidates
N = 899  # 29 × 31
window_radius = 10
candidates = map_points_to_candidates(points, N, window_radius)
```

### Replicated Analysis

```python
from qmc_engines import qmc_points

cfg = QMCConfig(
    dim=2,
    n=128,
    engine="rank1_lattice",
    lattice_generator="cyclic",
    subgroup_order=20,
    scramble=True,
    seed=42,
    replicates=16  # For confidence intervals
)

# Generate multiple independent replicates
for replicate_idx, X in enumerate(qmc_points(cfg)):
    candidates = map_points_to_candidates(X, N, window_radius)
    # Analyze each replicate...
```

### Statistical Analysis

```python
from qmc_factorization_analysis import QMCFactorization

# Compare all methods including rank-1 lattices
df = QMCFactorization.run_statistical_analysis(
    n=899,
    num_samples=128,
    num_trials=100,
    include_enhanced=True,
    include_rank1=True  # Enable rank-1 lattice methods
)

# Results include:
# - MC, QMC, Sobol-Owen, Halton-Scrambled

### When to Use Rank-1 Lattices

**Recommended for:**

## Conclusion

The integration of subgroup-based rank-1 lattice constructions provides a theoretically-motivated alternative to standard QMC methods for RSA factorization. The cyclic subgroup construction, in particular, leverages the algebraic structure of the multiplicative group (ℤ/Nℤ)*, providing enhanced regularity properties with explicit bounds on point distribution quality.

While current results show competitive performance with Sobol/Halton methods, the theoretical foundation and group-theoretic alignment make rank-1 lattices a valuable addition to the QMC variance reduction toolkit, particularly for applications where algebraic structure plays an important role.
