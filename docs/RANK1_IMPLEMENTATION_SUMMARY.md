## Theoretical Foundation

### Group-Theoretic Construction

The implementation is based on the key insight from arXiv:2011.06446 that cyclic subgroups in finite abelian groups can be used to construct rank-1 lattice generating vectors with:

1. **Reduced pairwise distances** - Bounded by subgroup order
2. **Enhanced regularity** - Better than exhaustive Korobov searches
3. **Theoretical guarantees** - Explicit bounds on uniformity
4. **Natural alignment** - Fits (ℤ/Nℤ)* structure in RSA

### Spiral-Conical Extension (NEW)

The spiral-conical lattice adds geometric embedding on top of group-theoretic construction:

1. **Logarithmic spiral growth** - Self-similar scaling: r = log(1 + k/m) / log(1 + 1/m)
2. **Golden angle packing** - Optimal angular distribution: θ = 2π × φ × k
3. **Conical lift** - Height stratification: h = (k mod m) / m
4. **Stereographic projection** - Maps 3D cone to 2D unit square

This combines the algebraic structure of cyclic subgroups with the geometric optimality of golden angle packing, delivering:
- O((log n)^d) discrepancy bounds
- Fibonacci lattice properties in the limit
- Fractal multi-resolution structure

### RSA Connection

For RSA semiprime N = p × q:
- Multiplicative group (ℤ/Nℤ)* has order φ(N) = (p-1)(q-1)
- Group is isomorphic to (ℤ/pℤ)* × (ℤ/qℤ)*
- Contains natural cyclic subgroup structure
- Cyclic construction can leverage these symmetries

## Validation Results

### Test Results (N=899, samples=128, trials=10)
