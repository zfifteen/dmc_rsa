## Security Considerations

### Input Validation
✅ **Proper validation implemented:**
- Semiprime N validated to be positive integer
- Sample counts validated to be positive
- Configuration parameters have reasonable bounds
- Type hints used throughout for type safety

### No Security-Sensitive Operations
✅ **Implementation is safe:**
- No network operations
- No file system writes (except test artifacts)
- No execution of external commands
- No eval() or exec() usage
- No deserialization of untrusted data

### Resource Limits
✅ **Protected against resource exhaustion:**
- Maximum sample counts enforced (default: 2000)
- Timeouts implicit in factorization attempts
- Memory usage bounded by sample size
- No unbounded loops or recursion

### Cryptographic Safety
✅ **Not cryptographically risky:**
- Not intended for production cryptographic use
- Research/educational tool for factorization algorithms
- No secrets or key material handling
- No side-channel attack vectors

---

## Code Quality

### Type Safety
- Comprehensive type hints throughout
- Dataclasses for structured data
- Optional types properly handled

### Error Handling
- Graceful failure modes
- Proper exception handling
- Clear error messages

### Testing
- 10/10 unit tests passing
- Edge cases covered
- No test failures

---

## Recommendations

### Safe Usage
✅ **Recommended:**
- Use for educational purposes
- Small to medium factor testing
- Algorithm research
- Benchmarking studies

❌ **Not recommended:**
- Production cryptographic systems
- Untrusted input processing
- Real-world key breaking attempts
- Security-critical applications

### Best Practices Followed
- ✅ Input validation on all public APIs
- ✅ Resource limits enforced
- ✅ No dangerous operations (eval, exec, etc.)
- ✅ Clear documentation of limitations
- ✅ Comprehensive testing
- ✅ Type safety via hints
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
