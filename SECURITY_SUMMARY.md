## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Validation
✅ **Type checking** via type hints throughout  
✅ **Range validation** for parameters (n, d, subgroup_order)  
✅ **Coprimality checks** for generating vectors  
✅ **Power-of-2 validation** for Sobol sequences  
✅ **Bounds checking** on array indices  

### Safe Mathematical Operations
✅ **Modular arithmetic** using Python's built-in `pow(a, b, m)`  
✅ **GCD computation** using Euclidean algorithm (safe)  
✅ **Integer overflow protection** via Python's arbitrary precision  
✅ **Division by zero checks** where applicable  

### Memory Safety
✅ **NumPy arrays** for safe memory management  
✅ **No manual memory allocation**  
✅ **Bounded iterations** in all loops  
✅ **Efficient sampling** to prevent memory exhaustion  

### Error Handling
✅ **Explicit exceptions** with clear messages  
✅ **Warning system** for non-fatal issues  
✅ **Graceful degradation** (fallback to Fibonacci if cyclic fails)  
✅ **No silent failures**  

### Cryptographic Considerations
⚠️ **Note:** This implementation is for **research and education** on RSA factorization  
✅ **No cryptographic key generation**  
✅ **No storage of sensitive data**  
✅ **Uses standard NumPy random generators** (not cryptographically secure, but appropriate for Monte Carlo simulation)  
✅ **Clear documentation** about research purpose

## Code Review Findings

### Positive Security Patterns

1. **Type Safety**
   - Type hints on all functions
   - Runtime validation where needed
   - Clear parameter constraints

2. **Defensive Programming**
   - Validation before computation
   - Bounds checking on all array access
   - Warnings for edge cases

3. **Resource Management**
   - Efficient algorithms (no exponential complexity)
   - Bounded sampling for quality metrics
   - Caching to prevent redundant computation

4. **Error Messages**
   - Clear, informative error messages
   - No information leakage in errors
   - Appropriate exception types

### No Issues Found

❌ **No SQL injection** - No database access  
❌ **No command injection** - No shell command execution  
❌ **No path traversal** - No file system navigation from user input  
❌ **No XXE** - No XML parsing  
❌ **No SSRF** - No server-side requests  
❌ **No insecure deserialization** - No pickle/unsafe loading  
❌ **No hardcoded secrets** - No credentials in code
